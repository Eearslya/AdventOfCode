# Advent of Code
My solutions to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) in C.

Everything in this repo is free to use and learn from.

## Compilation
All of the solutions can be compiled simply by visiting their directories and using the `make` command.

The resulting binary will be named `prgm`, and any solutions requiring an input file will look for a file named `input`.

## Requirements
Day 12's solution requires the [Jansson C Library](http://www.digip.org/jansson/) for JSON parsing.
